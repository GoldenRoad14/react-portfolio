                <span className="text-header">Hi I'm Matt</span>, <br></br>A web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional digital experiences. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to leverage my skills and passion for web development in a collaborative and innovative environment. <br></br><br></br>My journey into web development began in high school, in the 90s, when I was captivated by web design. I ended up pursuing a different path in college and in my first career. Recently, while working as a freelance graphic designer and photographer, I began to build websites for local businesses utilizing a white-label design platform. This rekindled my love for web development and I decided to dive back in, enrolling in a full stack web development program at Vanderbilt to enhance my skills and learn new technologies.

                  <span className="text-header">My Background</span>
                  <br></br>
                  With a background in graphic design, I've naturally gravitated towards front-end development, where I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, delving into the backend and understanding how to build a full stack application from scratch has been an exciting experience for me. I'm proficient in a variety of technologies, including JavaScript, React, MySQL, MongoDB, and Node.js.

                  <span className="text-header">Notable Projects</span>
                  <br></br>
                  Throughout my coursework, I've worked on several exciting projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. One of my proudest achievements is a full-stack blackjack game, where I was able to collaborate with a team and design the application from the ground up. Additionally, I developed a full stack application called Hamster Brain targeted at people suffering from ADHD aimed at accountability and task management. My team utilized React, Vite, JavaScript, JSON, MongoDB, Apollo Server, JWT, GraphQL, Node & CSS.

                  {/* <span className="text-header">Problem-Solving Approach</span>
                  <br></br>
                  When faced with challenges, I adopt a methodical approach, breaking down problems into manageable chunks. By tackling each issue one step at a time, I find that solutions begin to unravel naturally. If I encounter a roadblock, I switch gears and work on another aspect of the problem while allowing my subconscious to mull over potential solutions in the background.

                  My journey in web development has only just begun, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field. I'm drawn to the ever-changing nature of the industry, which presents endless opportunities for skill development and innovation. Ultimately, my dream is to establish an all-encompassing creative agency that specializes in providing affordable technological solutions for non-profit organizations, helping them make a meaningful impact in their communities. */}
