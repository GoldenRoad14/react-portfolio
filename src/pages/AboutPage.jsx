                <span className="text-header">Hi I'm Matt</span>, <br></br>a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional digital experiences. My journey into web development began in high school when I was captivated by web design. I ended up pursuing a different path in college and in my first career.  Recently, while working as a freelance graphic designer and photographer, I rediscovered my love for web development and decided to dive back in, embarking on a journey to enhance my skills and learn new technologies.

                  <span className="text-header">My Background</span>
                  <br></br>
                  With a background in graphic design, I've naturally gravitated towards front-end development, where I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, delving into the backend and understanding how both sides work together has been an eye-opening experience for me. I'm proficient in a variety of technologies, including JavaScript, React, MySQL, MongoDB, and Node.js.

                  <span className="text-header">Notable Projects</span>
                  <br></br>
                  Throughout my coursework, I've worked on several exciting projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. One of my proudest achievements is a full-stack blackjack game, where I was able to collaborate. Additionally, I'm currently working on a second full-stack React project, the details of which are still to be determined.

                  <span className="text-header">Problem-Solving Approach</span>
                  <br></br>
                  When faced with challenges, I adopt a methodical approach, breaking down problems into manageable chunks. By tackling each issue one step at a time, I find that solutions begin to unravel naturally. If I encounter a roadblock, I switch gears and work on another aspect of the problem while allowing my subconscious to mull over potential solutions in the background.

                  <span className="text-header">Future Goals</span>
                  <br></br>
                  My journey in web development has only just begun, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field. I'm drawn to the ever-changing nature of the industry, which presents endless opportunities for skill development and innovation. Ultimately, my dream is to establish an all-encompassing creative agency that specializes in providing technological solutions for non-profit organizations, helping them make a meaningful impact in their communities.
